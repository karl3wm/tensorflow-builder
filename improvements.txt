Tensorflow maintains a docker-oriented build system with dependency versioning and such that I did not know about when I started this.
Around https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/tf_sig_build_dockerfiles#build-tf-nightly-and-run-pip-tests

- pip_new.sh at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/ci_build/builds/pip_new.sh
  looks quite useful but is not upgraded to the new wheel building script

Different platforms are referenced in that ci_build folder.

- official ci scripts at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/ci/official/README.md
  also look quite useful but have not quite stabilized yet after many versions, documented in the readme in the parent ci folder

Finding the built tensorflow dockers would find dockerfiles that run them and may be the most promising avenue here.

Note that docker builds are documented in the tensorflow build docs.

These docker images may be built by .github/workflows in the repositories, I saw some there.
